# In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.
# You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.
# The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
# If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

# Example 1:
# Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
# Output: [[1,2,3,4]]

# Example 2:
# Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
# Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]

# Constraints:
# m == mat.length
# n == mat[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 100
# -1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000
# 1 <= r, c <= 300

        if r * c != len(flatten):   # when given parameters is NOT possible and legal
            return mat
        else:
            for row_index in range(r):
                output.append(flatten[row_index * c : row_index * c + c])
            return output
